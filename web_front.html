                Hi, my name is Mahathi Mandelli, and I'm an international
                graduate student from India. I'm currently enjoying my
                first-time experience in a new country. I hail from the southern
                part of India, which is known for its diverse cultures. When I
                was younger, I had a passion for three things: art, music, and
                cooking. I have a great love for music and enjoy singing and
                listening to all kinds of genres. One of my hobbies is creating
                playlists on Spotify. I have been learning Carnatic music for
                the past 11 years and have performed in a few live concerts with
                my team back in India. I also enjoy drawing pencil and pen
                sketches, and experimenting with food is my go-to stress
                reliever. I believe that good food equals good mood. Apart from
                this, I love traveling and exploring new cafes. My happy time is
                when I'm wandering around new streets with my earphones plugged
                in, listening to my favorite playlists. That's a little about
                me!

              <p>
                I completed my bachelor's degree in information technology at
                MVGR College of Engineering in India. The experience taught me
                that success requires hard work and perseverance, and it shaped
                me both personally and professionally. Alongside my academic
                studies, I participated in various extracurricular activities,
                discovering my passion for singing, art, and cooking. In my 3rd
                year, I did my internship as a manual tester at a startup
                company called “Manbrosys”. This experience enhanced my
                attention to detail and ability to identify and report software
                issues, while also teaching me important skills such as
                teamwork, communication, and adaptability in a fast-paced work
                environment. During my final year, I worked on a machine
                learning project where my team and I developed a CNN model to
                digitalize handwritten text, sparking my interest in the rapidly
                evolving field of technology. To expand my knowledge, I enrolled
                in a master's degree program in Computer Science at Portland
                State University.
