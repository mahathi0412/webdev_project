                Hi, my name is Mahathi Mandelli, and I'm an international
                graduate student from India. I'm currently enjoying my
                first-time experience in a new country. I hail from the southern
                part of India, which is known for its diverse cultures. When I
                was younger, I had a passion for three things: art, music, and
                cooking. I have a great love for music and enjoy singing and
                listening to all kinds of genres. One of my hobbies is creating
                playlists on Spotify. I have been learning Carnatic music for
                the past 11 years and have performed in a few live concerts with
                my team back in India. I also enjoy drawing pencil and pen
                sketches, and experimenting with food is my go-to stress
                reliever. I believe that good food equals good mood. Apart from
                this, I love traveling and exploring new cafes. My happy time is
                when I'm wandering around new streets with my earphones plugged
                in, listening to my favorite playlists. That's a little about
                me!
