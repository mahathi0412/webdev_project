I built this website project for my Intro to Web Development course. The website has 3 sections namely, "About me", "Previous work", "Projects" and "Contact me"
To build the webpage, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website consists of three files - index.html, web_style.css, and web_js.js - with the index.html file serving as the main file that links to the other two. 
The website can be viewed at https://mahathi0412.github.io/webdev_project/ . To access the website, just open the index.html file.
