I built this website project for my Intro to Web Development course. To build the webpage, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website consists of three files - index.html, style.css, and script.js - with the index.html file serving as the main file that links to the other two. The website can be viewed at https://mahathi0412.github.io/webdev_project/ . To access the website, just open the index.html file.
